# YoungTableau
YoungTableau in python , visualisation in latex also supported
This is a small project me and my friend worked on. It creates a YoungTableau from a given string or the other way around>
It makes a string out of a youngtableau (a.k.a as the word of the youngtableau)
See file tests for examples of how to test the program.
Any feedback would be appreciated .
